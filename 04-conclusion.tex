\chapter{Conclusion}
In the end, this study demonstrates the significant impact of using spatial weather masks in model training.
By comparing a base line with uniform weather masks to a model with unique spatial masks for each weather condition, we observed notable improvements in the modelâ€™s ability to predict distorted camera images. Although the SPADE model initially faced underfitting issues, these were mitigated with extended training epochs.
The findings highlight the importance of tailored weather masks in enhancing model accuracy and robustness, paving the way for more reliable predictions in varying weather conditions.
