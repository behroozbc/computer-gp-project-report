During this project, I set up and worked with the Boreas dataset, a comprehensive multi-season autonomous driving dataset collected over one year. It includes over 350 kilometers of driving data with seasonal variations and adverse weather conditions like rain and heavy snow. The dataset features high-quality sensors, including a 128-channel Velodyne Alpha Prime lidar, a 360-degree Navtech radar, and accurate ground truth poses from an Applanix POSLV GPS/IMU2. These features make it invaluable for developing and testing robust models in diverse environments.
I managed to set up ten parts of this dataset. The seting up of this dataset requires to work with its toolkit which only run on linux systems and has bug on windows os.
