\section{Setup}
\subsection{Dataset}
Requirements for the Dataset on this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Large Dataset: The dataset should be extensive to cover a wide range of scenarios.
    \item Multiple Weather Conditions: It should include data from various weather conditions to ensure robustness.
\end{itemize}
Dataset Recommendation: A dataset that meets these requirements is BOARS.\\
This dataset offers several benefits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Comprehensive Toolkit: A toolkit is provided to assist with using the dataset.
    \item Weather Diversity: The dataset includes data from multiple weather conditions.
\end{itemize}
However it has some drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linux-Only Toolkit: The toolkit is compatible only with Linux devices.
    \item Hardware Requirements: The toolkit requires radar, LiDAR, and camera data to function.
    \item Large File Sizes: Each part of the dataset is quite large, with each section being approximately 100GB, making it difficult to download.
    \item Poor Documentation: The documentation for each section of the dataset is inadequate.
    \item Third-Party Software: Downloading parts of the dataset requires installing third-party software from Amazon.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model}
The pix2pix and SPADE is my choice.
